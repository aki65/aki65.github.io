  <p>This app allows you to play and analyse go/baduk/weiqi with two very strong AIs:</p>

  <p>1) <b>Katago</b>: 
    To my knowledge the first native implementation on android. 
    You can choose between a 10 blocks network (the latest one from extended training) 
    and a 20 blocks network (from version 1.5.0) resp. an 18b network (the latest one from
		katagotraining.org) if your device supports it.
    Moreover you can load a network from your device storage. 
    The 10 blocks network runs on CPU. 
    The 18/20 blocks network is optimized for android and will use HW acceleration if possible.</p>

  <p>2) <b>LeelaZero</b>: 
    You can choose between a 15 blocks network (trained against 40b self-play) 
    and a 40 blocks network (LZ 287). 
    Moreover you can load a network from your device storage. 
    The implementation is optimized for android and will use HW acceleration if possible.</p>

  <p>The UI is an extension of Alexander Taylor's excellent app "LazyBaduk" (with kind permission from him). Most of it is self-explanatory but some hints may be helpful:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="#top_row">Top row</a></li>
    <li><a href="#settings">Settings</a></li>
    <li><a href="#board">Board</a></li>
    <li><a href="#control">Control buttons</a></li>
    <li><a href="#strength">How to adjust AI's strength for playing against it</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="top_row">Top row</h3>
  <p>The two bullets in the top-left corner indicate whose turn it is. 
    You can switch this by tapping on the bullets (if no moves have been played yet).</p>

	<p>By tapping the button with the green circle in the top row 
    you can switch the displaying of analyzed moves on and off.</p>

  <p>By tapping the dashed rectangle in the top row you can restrict AI analysis to a region 
    (which consists of a rectangle plus additional points): 
    First a dialog pops up, where you can switch the restriction on and off, 
    enter the coordinates of the additional points 
    and choose how many subsequent moves must be inside the region. 
    Afterwards you can define the rectangle on the board by dragging 
    from its top left corner to the bottom right one.</p>

  <h3 id="settings">Settings</h3>
  <p>The settings menu in the top right corner allows you to 
    switch networks, engines and adjust game settings:</p>

  <p>The name of the network currently used is displayed in the 
    first field (LeelaZero) resp. second field (KataGo). 
    If you tap on this field, a dialog opens which allows you to manage the networks: 
    You can delete internal networks which you don't intend to use (to save storage) 
    or you can load network files from your device storage. 
    For KataGo you can load either standard or optimized networks in this way, 
    for LeelaZero only optimized networks. 
    If you want to load an optimized network (which always consists of two files), 
    you must choose both files, one after the other (necessary because otherwise 
    the latest android versions won't grant access to both files for BadukAI). 
    You can find optimized networks
    <a href="https://github.com/aki65/aki65.github.io/releases">here</a>.
		The most recent KataGo networks for the different sizes are:
		<ul id="networks">
      <li><a href="https://github.com/aki65/aki65.github.io/releases/tag/v1.20.5">
	        18 blocks (requires app version 1.18.8 or higher and will run fast on recent Snapdragon chipsets)</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/aki65/aki65.github.io/releases/tag/v1.20.14">
	        28 blocks (requires app version 1.19.5 or higher and will run fast on recent Snapdragon chipsets)</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/aki65/aki65.github.io/releases/tag/v1.16.0">
					40 blocks (requires app version 1.16 or higher and will run fast on recent Dimensity and older Snapdragon chipsets)</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/aki65/aki65.github.io/releases/tag/v1.15.0">
				  60 blocks (requires app version 1.15 or higher and will run fast on recent Dimensity and older Snapdragon chipsets)</a></li>
		</ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    By tapping on <b>"Edit config"</b> you can open a dialog for changing the AI engine configuration. 
    Most parameters are directly passed to AI and can be found in the engine's documentation. 
    With "useSpecificNpuAccelerator" you can set the NPU accelerator, that BadukAI should use. 
    By default, BadukAI makes a reasonable choice, 
    but that will not be optimal for all devices. 
    So, to optimize performance, 
    you can try all the available choices and check which one runs fastest.
    Be sure there is a NPU on your phone chip.
  </p>

  <p>
		By tapping on <b>"Configure AI opponent"</b> you can open a dialog to set up your AI opponent.
		You can use
		<ul>
      <li>standard KataGo (by default very strong, but look
		    <a href="index.html#strength">here</a> for possibilities to make it weaker)
			</li>
			<li>rank algorithm from KaTrain (A calibrated bot, which roughly has the chosen strength,
				will make the AI moves. For the strength calibration to fit, you have to use the 18b or 20b network.
				Rank settings above 4-dan have to be taken with a grain of salt: 
        Strength will increase, but not by much, so that 9-dan will be a lot weaker than human 9-dan.
				You might want to combine this bot with activating "opening book" to get a human-style fuseki.)
			</li>
		  <li id="humansl"> KataGo human SL (uses a specialized neural network, which was trained to mimic human
				moves of the strength chosen. You can download the network
				<a href="https://media.katagotraining.org/uploaded/networks/models_extra/b18c384nbt-humanv0.bin.gz">
			  here</a>)
			</li>
		</ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    With the checkbox <b>"winrate on play"</b> you can toggle whether winrates are also
    shown during play (not only in analysis). If ticked, the winrate will be
    displayed for all moves of the AI.
  </p>

	<p>
		With the checkbox <b>"memorizing mode"</b> you can switch to a mode for memorizing joseki and
		middle game sequences. If you load an sgf in this mode, you are supposed to enter all variations
		in the sgf on the board. If a move is wrong, the app will beep and reject it. If you can't remember
		a move, select "game tree" (the only way to navigate in this mode) and step to one of the correct
		following moves. If you successfully complete a variation, the app will inform you and jump back
		to the starting position to allow you to enter the next variation. All variations done are marked
		on the board, so you don't have to keep track yourself. When all variations are completed,
		a message will pop up and you are done.
	</p>

  <p>
		By tapping <b>"Set board appearance"</b> you can customize the look of the board by
		choosing your own images of board and stones. Moreover, you can toggle the
		display of the "next move" marker and the numbering of stones. Furthermore, you can
		limit	the number of	analyzed moves that are shown on the board. Additionally,
		you can switch to a fun variation of the game called "One color go": All
    stones played appear in the same color (the one that you choose in the combobox
		"all stones in same color"). This a fun way to train your (shape)
    memory. The setting applies only to newly played stones, not to existing
    ones. So, if you play a one-colored game and want to see the current
    position with both colors, you have to set the "all stones in same color" option to "-",
    then jump to the beginning of the game (by tapping on the first segment of
    the histogram), then jump back to the end (by tapping on the last segment of
    the histogram). In this way you force BadukAI to re-play all the stones, so
    that the new setting applies, so that the stones will have normal colors
    again.
  </p>

  <p>
    Below you can configure what the <b>area below the board</b> will show:
  </p>
  <ul>
		<li>tree view of all game variations (By long tapping on a node you can open
			a dialog to enter a comment. If a node with a comment is selected, the
			comment is displayed below the tree view. By tapping slightly above or below
			the comment, you can scroll up and down. By double-tapping on the comment,
			you can open the dialog to edit the comment).
		</li>
    <li>histogram of winrate</li>
    <li>
      histogram of difference between white's winrates in this position and the previous
      position, capped at the value (in percent) that you enter in the text
      field following ±, i.e. if you enter 10 the histogram will range from -10%
      (bottom) to +10% (top)
    </li>
    <li>
      histogram of difference between white's score leads in this position and the previous
      position, capped at the value that you enter in the text field following ±
    </li>
  </ul>	

	<p>
    By tapping <b>"Manage time settings"</b> you can set constraints on thinking time
    for yourself and AI: "seconds/move" will be used by AI during play. If you
    enter a positive number in the field "visits/move in analysis", then this
    number of visits will be executed on each move during "analyse all". Otherwise
    the time specified in "seconds/move" will be spent. If you enter a positive number in
		"max pondering time per position (in secs)", then the AI will stop analyzing a
		position after that amount of time, when you have tapped "ponder". Otherwise it
		will analyze until you hit "ponder" again. With "variations animation speed"
		you can adjust how fast BadukAI shows a variation (when you hold your finger on
		the analyzed move, see below). With "autoplay animation speed" you can control the
		speed of autoplay (triggered by long tap on "<" or ">", see below).
  </p>

	<p>
		By tapping on the combobox besides <b>"rules"</b>, you can customize the rules: There are
		seven rule elements ("Ko", "Scoring", ...) that you can set (for a detailed description
		of their meaning please refer to
		<a href="https://lightvector.github.io/KataGo/rules.html">KataGo's Supported Go Rules</a>).
		As a shortcut, you can tap on one of the well-known standard rulesets like "Chinese",
		this will adjust all rule elements accordingly.
	</p>

  <h3 id="board">Board</h3>
  <p>
    If you touch the board, a preview of the stone to be played will be shown.
    You can adjust its position by dragging your finger across the board (stone
    position is always 3 lines above your finger). Lifting off your finger
    finally places the stone. The 3-line-offset can be switched off in the
    settings.
  </p>
  <p>
		You can pan, zoom and rotate the board (by multiples of 90°) with two fingers.
	</p>
  <p>
    The area below the board shows a kind of winrate histogram. The area is
    divided into as many segments as moves have been loaded (from sgf) and/or
    played. By tapping on a segment you can navigate to the corresponding move,
    resp. position. The current position is indicated by a red triangle. If a
    position has been analysed by AI the (originally grey) corresponding segment
    is coloured black/white such that the size of the white area is proportional
    to white's winrate.
  </p>

  <p>
    The histogram always shows a linear sequence of moves (there is just no
    space for a complete win-rated game tree). If you load an sgf (either by the
    button or by sharing an sgf from another app to BadukAI), the main line of
    the sgf will be shown. If you then switch to a variation by tapping "next
    var" at a branching position, the histogram will show the move sequence from
    game start up to the end of the variation. Similarly, if you enter moves
    manually or let the AI generate moves to explore a position, you create a
    new variation and the histogram will again show the sequence from game start
    to the end of the variation.
  </p>

  <p>
    Even though the histogram shows only one move sequence, the button "save
    sgf" will save the complete game tree.
  </p>

  <p>
    When AI analyses a position, the best moves (up to ten) appear below the
    winrate histogram in order of quality. While you hold your finger on such a
    move, the primary variation following that move is displayed on the board.
    If you hold your finger on the first button (named "own") of the row, the
    ownership prediction by AI is shown by a transparent overlay on the board.
  </p>

  <h3 id="control">Control buttons</h3>
  <p>
    By tapping "ponder" you can make AI analyse the current position: The
    winrate in the histogram and the display of the best moves on the board and
    below the histogram will be continously updated until you stop analysis by
    tapping "ponder" again. If you enter a positive number in "max pondering time per position (in secs)"
		in manage time settings, then the analysis will be paused after that amount of time
		has been spent on a position (until the position changes).
  </p>

  <p>
    If you tap "analyse all", AI will analyse each position from the current one
    to the end of the sequence in the histogram (spending "seconds/move" or
    "visits/move in analysis" from the settings on each position). Afterwards
    the histogram will show all winrates so that you can detect sudden changes
    in the winrate (which hint at mistakes) and have a closer look at these
    positions.
  </p>

  <p>
    By tapping "<", ">", "next var" and "back to main" you can navigate through
    the game tree. "next var" doesn't change the position, but switches to the
    next variation. As a result the circle, which indicates the next move, will
    change. If you tap ">" afterwards, you will advance into the chosen
    variation. If you are already on the last variation, "next var" will switch
    to the first one（the main var）. "back to main" will always take you back to the main line
		(to the position where your chosen variation left off the main line).
		A long tap on "<" or ">" will start autoplay (speed can be changed via
	  "settings" -> "Manage time settings" -> "autoplay animation speed").
		To stop autoplay, press "<" or ">" again.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you have loaded an sgf with only set stones (i.e no moves), the
    navigation buttons in the second row are useless, so they mutate into
    editing buttons: After tapping "add B stone" you can put any number of black
    stones on the board (in the same way as you would play them). Same goes for
    white stones. After tapping "remove stone" you can place a cross on the
    board (in the same way as a stone). By placing it on an existing stone, you
    can remove that stone.
  </p>

  <p>
    By tapping the marked editing button again (whichever it is), you can stop
    its editing function. In that state, touching the board will play a stone as
    usual.
  </p>

  <p>
    To play handicap, just put the handicap stones on the board (as described
    above), tap on the white bullet in the top left corner to make it white's
    turn, then tap "play W" to let AI play white.
  </p>

  <p>
    After tapping "load sgf", you can not only load sgf files, but also images
    of a go board or a part of it. BadukAI will then detect the board and stones
    in the image and display the resulting board position. For that to work, you
    must tell BadukAI what to look for, more precisely:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      How many horizontal lines does the board fragment in the image contain ?
    </li>
    <li>
      How many vertical lines does the board fragment in the image contain ?
    </li>
    <li>
      Is it a corner or a side ? More generally, which edges are contained in
      the image ?
    </li>
  </ul>

  For this tsumego, for example:
  <span style="text-align: center; display: block">
    <img width="300" src="corner.png" />
  </span>
  <p>you would have to set the following contents information:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>7 horizontal lines</li>
    <li>9 vertical lines</li>
    <li>left and bottom edge</li>
  </ul>

  And for a full board it's of course: 19 vertical lines, 19 horizontal lines,
  all edges.

  <p>You can do it in both orders:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      First load the image (or take the photo): Then the dialog will re-appear
      afterwards with the image displayed on the right. Then edit the contents
      information, then tap "Detect stones in image above".
    </li>
  </ul>

  or
  <ul>
    <li>
      First edit the contents information, then check "Detect stones in new
      image right after ...", then load the image (or take the photo). Then
      BadukAI will analyze the image immediately without showing the dialog
      again.
    </li>
  </ul>

  The second way is faster, but only possible if you know the image contents in
  advance before seeing the image in the app (for example, if you will take a
  photo of a board in front of you).

	<p>
	After you have loaded a position by detecting stones in an image, you can compare
	the detected stones to the image by tapping "show img". The stones will be displayed
	in red over the image. So, if there have been any detection errors, they can be easily
	corrected by "add W stone", "add B stone" or "remove stone".
	</p>

  <h3 id="strength">How to adjust AI's strength for playing against it</h3>

  <p>For KataGo you can</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      set the strength approximately to a human rank by using
      the "rank algorithm (from KaTrain)" or "KataGo human SL"
			via "Configure AI opponent" in settings
    </li>
    <li>experiment on your own by choosing "standard KataGo" as AI opponent and </li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        loading a weaker network from your storage by tapping on the second
        field in settings
      </li>
      <li>
        reduce the amount of analysis by reducing "seconds/move" in manage time settings
      </li>
      <li>
        reduce the amount of analysis even further by setting "maxPlayouts" to a
        small number via "Edit config" in settings
      </li>
    </ul>
  </ul>

  <p>For LeelaZero you can</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      reduce the amount of analysis by reducing "seconds/move" in manage time settings
    </li>
    <li>
      reduce the amount of analysis even further by setting "maxPlayouts" to a
      small number via "Edit config" in settings
    </li>
  </ul>
